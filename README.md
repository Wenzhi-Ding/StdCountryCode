# Standardize Country Code

This project is to help social science research to standardize country code in multinational research. We follow [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)[^1] to standardize country identifiers.

[^1]:This list does not take any political or religious conflict into account.

The list is now cross-sectional and we have a plan to develop it into a panel data.

Please feel free to contribute if you find any uncovered country name/number/code.
